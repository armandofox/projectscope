Feature: Pivotal Tracker
  As an instructor
  So that I can tell whether a project group is utilizing Pivotal Tracker
    correctly, and their development is progressing smoothly
  I want to see a data visualization representing the length of time stories
    have been open and the points assigned to those stories
    
Background:
  Given I am on the home page
  
Scenario: Open stories
  Then I should see a graphic showing length of time stories have been open
  
Scenario: Points assigned to stories
  Then I should see a graphic showing points assigned to stories
